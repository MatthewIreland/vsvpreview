- make note that you can't have an empty timecode in the frame header, since you need to know what segment it belongs to!
- parallelise frame processing
- stop spawning the Perl interpreter so much!
- grey image overlays
- process newline as separate token in lexer, so that line numbers in error messages mean something
- add an "if" statement to check disappearing timecode is not the end-of-frame timecode.


Tests:
- mangled timecodes
-- 
- invalid timecodes
-- segment number
-- 60 second minute
--
